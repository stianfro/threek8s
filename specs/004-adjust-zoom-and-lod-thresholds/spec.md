# Feature Specification: Adjust Initial Zoom and LOD Thresholds

## Overview
Improve the initial viewport experience by adjusting the camera zoom level to better fit nodes and pods within the window, and modify Level of Detail (LOD) thresholds to make pods visible from greater distances.

## User Stories
1. As a user, I want the Kubernetes cluster visualization to fill the viewport efficiently on initial load, so I don't need to manually zoom in to see the cluster details.
2. As a user, I want to see pod details from a greater distance, so I can understand the cluster structure without excessive zooming.

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Initial Camera Zoom Adjustment
- The initial camera position must be calculated to fit all nodes and pods within the viewport
- Nodes and pods should occupy approximately 80-90% of the available viewport space
- Minimal whitespace should remain around the cluster visualization
- The zoom calculation must account for different cluster sizes and node distributions

### FR2: LOD Threshold Optimization
- Pod visibility distance must be increased by adjusting LOD thresholds
- Pod representations should become visible at approximately 1.5-2x the current distance
- LOD transitions should remain smooth and performant
- Different LOD levels should maintain visual clarity at their respective distances

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Performance
- Zoom adjustments must not impact initial load time by more than 100ms
- LOD changes must maintain 60fps rendering performance
- Memory usage should not increase significantly with adjusted LOD thresholds

### NFR2: User Experience
- Initial view must provide immediate context of the entire cluster
- Zoom transitions must be smooth if animated
- LOD transitions should not cause visual pop-in effects

## Technical Constraints
- Must work with existing Three.js camera system
- Must integrate with current @kubernetes/client-node data structures
- Should maintain compatibility with existing WebSocket real-time updates
- Must support various viewport sizes (responsive design)

## Success Criteria
1. On initial load, nodes occupy 80-90% of the viewport space
2. Pods are visible at 1.5-2x the previous distance threshold
3. No performance degradation (maintains 60fps)
4. Works across different cluster sizes (1-100+ nodes)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Initial zoom fits all nodes with minimal whitespace
- [ ] Pods visible from increased distance
- [ ] Performance metrics remain within acceptable ranges
- [ ] Smooth transitions between LOD levels
- [ ] Works on various screen sizes and resolutions

## Dependencies
- Three.js camera and controls system
- Existing LOD implementation in the visualization
- Current node and pod rendering components

## Clarifications

### Session 1: Initial Requirements Gathering
**Q: What specific percentage of viewport should the cluster occupy?**
A: The cluster should occupy 80-90% of the viewport, leaving 10-20% as padding for visual comfort and to prevent elements from touching viewport edges.

**Q: What is the current pod visibility distance that needs adjustment?**
A: Currently pods become visible only when zoomed in to see approximately 1/3 of the total cluster. They should be visible when viewing 2/3 of the cluster or more.

**Q: Should the zoom adjustment be animated or instant on load?**
A: Instant positioning on initial load for immediate usability. Animation can be considered for future enhancement.

**Q: Are there specific performance benchmarks to maintain?**
A: Yes, maintain 60fps rendering and keep initial load time impact under 100ms.

**Q: Should zoom behavior differ based on cluster size?**
A: Yes, the algorithm should adapt to fit clusters ranging from single node to 100+ nodes efficiently.
