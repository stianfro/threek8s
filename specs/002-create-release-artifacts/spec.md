# Feature Specification: Release Artifacts Creation

**Feature Branch**: `002-create-release-artifacts`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create release artifacts for the application so users easily can use in their own environment."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25
- Q: What are the release artifacts? → A: Frontend Docker image, Backend Docker image, Helm chart
- Q: Configuration method? → A: Environment variables with defaults
- Q: Target platform? → A: Kubernetes
- Q: Distribution channel? → A: ghcr.io/stianfro/threek8s/<componentname>
- Q: Version management? → A: Release Please for semver, chart/app versions separate

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator or developer, I want to obtain pre-packaged release artifacts of the ThreeK8s application so that I can easily deploy and run the application in my own Kubernetes environment without needing to build from source code.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user wants to deploy ThreeK8s, **When** they access the release artifacts, **Then** they receive Docker images for frontend and backend, plus a Helm chart for deployment
2. **Given** release artifacts are available, **When** a user follows the Helm deployment instructions, **Then** the application successfully starts in their Kubernetes cluster
3. **Given** multiple deployment environments exist, **When** users deploy the Helm chart, **Then** they can configure the application through environment variables with sensible defaults
4. **Given** a new version is released, **When** users access release artifacts, **Then** they can identify the version through semantic versioning tags and view release notes
5. **Given** Helm chart updates independently from the application, **When** users check versions, **Then** they can see both chart version and application version separately

### Edge Cases
- What happens when environment variables are missing? (System uses working defaults)
- How does the system handle incorrect Kubernetes cluster configuration? (Deployment fails with clear error messages)
- What occurs if users try to deploy mismatched frontend/backend versions? (Helm chart ensures version consistency)
- How are registry authentication failures handled? (Clear error messages about ghcr.io access)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide three release artifacts: frontend Docker image, backend Docker image, and Helm chart
- **FR-002**: Docker images MUST be self-contained and not require building from source code
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide clear Helm deployment instructions with the release artifacts
- **FR-004**: Helm chart MUST orchestrate both backend and frontend components of the application
- **FR-005**: System MUST support configuration through environment variables with working defaults
- **FR-006**: Release artifacts MUST use semantic versioning managed by Release Please
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide artifacts as Docker images and Helm chart
- **FR-008**: System MUST support deployment to Kubernetes clusters
- **FR-009**: Docker images MUST include all required runtime dependencies
- **FR-010**: Artifact integrity verification is not required in current iteration
- **FR-011**: Helm chart MUST include documentation for all environment variable configuration options
- **FR-012**: Update mechanism is out of scope for this repository
- **FR-013**: Release artifacts MUST be published to ghcr.io/stianfro/threek8s/<componentname>
- **FR-014**: Helm chart MUST support independent versioning from application version
- **FR-015**: System MUST tag Docker images with version numbers for each release
- **FR-016**: Release automation MUST trigger on semantic version tags created by Release Please

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Frontend Docker Image**: Container image for the ThreeK8s frontend application published to ghcr.io/stianfro/threek8s/frontend
- **Backend Docker Image**: Container image for the ThreeK8s backend application published to ghcr.io/stianfro/threek8s/backend
- **Helm Chart**: Kubernetes deployment package published to ghcr.io/stianfro/threek8s/chart with independent chart version
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration mechanism with working defaults for customizing deployment
- **Version Metadata**: Semantic version tags managed by Release Please, with separate chart and application versions
