# Research: Release Artifacts Creation

## Docker Image Strategy

**Decision**: Multi-stage builds with Node.js Alpine base images
**Rationale**:
- Alpine provides smallest base image size (<100MB goal)
- Multi-stage builds reduce final image size by excluding build dependencies
- Node.js 20+ LTS for stability and performance
**Alternatives considered**:
- Distroless images (rejected: harder debugging)
- Ubuntu base (rejected: larger size ~500MB)
- Scratch base (rejected: missing required system libraries)

## Container Registry Choice

**Decision**: GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
**Rationale**:
- Native GitHub integration with Actions
- Free for public repositories
- Supports multi-arch manifests
- Automatic authentication with GITHUB_TOKEN
**Alternatives considered**:
- Docker Hub (rejected: rate limits, separate authentication)
- AWS ECR (rejected: vendor lock-in, additional costs)
- Self-hosted registry (rejected: maintenance overhead)

## Helm Chart Structure

**Decision**: Standard Helm 3 chart with values-based configuration
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard for Kubernetes deployments
- Supports templating and value overrides
- Easy version management (Chart.yaml)
- Wide tooling support
**Alternatives considered**:
- Kustomize (rejected: less flexible for end users)
- Raw Kubernetes manifests (rejected: no templating)
- Operators (rejected: too complex for simple deployment)

## Version Management

**Decision**: Release Please with Conventional Commits
**Rationale**:
- Automated semantic versioning
- Changelog generation
- PR-based release workflow
- GitHub native solution
**Alternatives considered**:
- semantic-release (rejected: more complex setup)
- Manual versioning (rejected: error-prone)
- GitVersion (rejected: .NET focused)

## Multi-Architecture Support

**Decision**: Docker buildx with QEMU emulation
**Rationale**:
- Native Docker solution
- GitHub Actions runner support
- Builds both amd64 and arm64
- Single manifest for all architectures
**Alternatives considered**:
- Native runners per architecture (rejected: cost and complexity)
- Cross-compilation (rejected: Node.js complexity)
- Single architecture only (rejected: limits deployment options)

## CI/CD Pipeline

**Decision**: GitHub Actions with matrix builds
**Rationale**:
- Native to GitHub repository
- Free for public repos
- Matrix strategy for parallel builds
- Good secrets management
**Alternatives considered**:
- Jenkins (rejected: requires hosting)
- GitLab CI (rejected: requires migration)
- CircleCI (rejected: additional service to manage)

## Environment Configuration

**Decision**: Environment variables with dotenv support
**Rationale**:
- Kubernetes native ConfigMap/Secret support
- 12-factor app compliance
- Runtime configuration without rebuilds
- Industry standard approach
**Alternatives considered**:
- Config files (rejected: requires volume mounts)
- Build-time configuration (rejected: requires rebuilds)
- External configuration service (rejected: adds complexity)

## Chart Versioning Strategy

**Decision**: Independent chart version with appVersion reference
**Rationale**:
- Allows chart updates without app changes
- Clear separation of concerns
- Helm standard practice
- Supports chart-only fixes
**Alternatives considered**:
- Locked versions (rejected: limits flexibility)
- Automatic sync (rejected: prevents chart-only updates)

## Build Optimization

**Decision**: Layer caching with dependency separation
**Rationale**:
- Faster builds in CI
- Reduced bandwidth usage
- Better Docker layer reuse
- Separate package.json copy for cache efficiency
**Alternatives considered**:
- No optimization (rejected: slow builds)
- Bazel/Nx caching (rejected: complexity)
- External cache services (rejected: additional dependency)

## Security Scanning

**Decision**: Trivy in CI pipeline (future enhancement)
**Rationale**:
- Free and open source
- GitHub Actions integration
- Comprehensive CVE database
- Fast scanning
**Alternatives considered**:
- Snyk (rejected: paid features needed)
- Clair (rejected: requires hosting)
- No scanning (current: acceptable for MVP)
