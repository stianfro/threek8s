# Feature Specification: Kubernetes Cluster 3D Visualization

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-an-application`
**Created**: 2025-01-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create an application that uses the three.js library to visualize Kubernetes showing all nodes and pods in a cluster."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-24
- Q: Cluster connection method? → A: Use kubeconfig file
- Q: Maximum scale to support? → A: No limit, realistically <100 nodes
- Q: Data refresh strategy? → A: Real-time updates
- Q: Resource information level? → A: Basic resource info only
- Q: Kubernetes version support? → A: Latest Kubernetes version
- Q: Namespace support scope? → A: All pods in all namespaces
- Q: Required RBAC permissions? → A: get,list,watch on pods/nodes/namespaces (cluster-reader)
- Q: Performance targets? → A: No specific targets

## Quick Guidelines
- Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Kubernetes administrator or developer, I want to visualize my Kubernetes cluster in 3D space so that I can quickly understand the cluster's structure, resource distribution, and the relationships between nodes and pods.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a running Kubernetes cluster with multiple nodes and pods, **When** the user opens the visualization application, **Then** they see all nodes and pods displayed in a 3D spatial representation
2. **Given** a 3D visualization of the cluster is displayed, **When** the user interacts with the visualization, **Then** they can navigate around the 3D space to view the cluster from different angles
3. **Given** nodes and pods are displayed, **When** the user selects a node or pod, **Then** relevant information about that resource is displayed
4. **Given** the cluster state changes, **When** pods are created or destroyed, **Then** the visualization updates to reflect the current state in real-time

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the cluster has a large number of resources (up to 100 nodes with their pods)?
- How does system handle connection loss to the Kubernetes cluster?
- What is displayed when the cluster has no pods or only one node?
- How does the application handle cluster authentication via kubeconfig file and permission errors?
- What happens when pods are rapidly created/destroyed?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display all nodes in the Kubernetes cluster in a 3D visualization
- **FR-002**: System MUST display all pods in the Kubernetes cluster with visual association to their host nodes
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide interactive 3D navigation controls (rotate, zoom, pan)
- **FR-004**: System MUST visually distinguish between different states of pods (Running, Pending, Failed, etc.)
- **FR-005**: System MUST visually distinguish between nodes (e.g., master vs worker nodes)
- **FR-006**: System MUST connect to Kubernetes cluster using kubeconfig file authentication
- **FR-007**: System MUST refresh visualization data in real-time as cluster state changes
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to select individual nodes and pods to view detailed information
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle clusters with up to 100 nodes and their associated pods
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide basic resource information (name, status, namespace)
- **FR-011**: System MUST support the latest Kubernetes version
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide clear visual feedback when unable to connect to the cluster
- **FR-013**: System MUST display pods from all namespaces in the cluster
- **FR-014**: System MUST have cluster-wide get, list, and watch permissions on pods, nodes, and namespaces
- **FR-015**: System MUST gracefully handle insufficient permissions with clear error messages

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Node**: Represents a Kubernetes node (physical or virtual machine) in the cluster, containing status, capacity, and role information
- **Pod**: Represents a Kubernetes pod, the smallest deployable unit, with associations to its host node, namespace, and container information
- **Cluster**: The overall Kubernetes cluster being visualized, containing connection information and metadata
- **Namespace**: Logical grouping of pods within the cluster (all namespaces will be visualized)
