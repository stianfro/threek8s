# Implementation Plan: Kubernetes Cluster 3D Visualization

**Branch**: `001-create-an-application` | **Date**: 2025-01-24 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-create-an-application/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Create a real-time 3D visualization application for Kubernetes clusters using Three.js, displaying all nodes as boxes containing pods (represented as smaller boxes inside). The application connects to actual clusters via kubeconfig, provides hover interactions for basic metrics, and animates pod creation/deletion events. Supporting up to 100 nodes with real-time updates via Kubernetes watch API.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: JavaScript/TypeScript (ES2022+), Node.js 20+
**Primary Dependencies**: Three.js (3D visualization), @kubernetes/client-node (K8s API), Express/WebSocket (real-time)
**Storage**: N/A (connects to external cluster, no persistent storage)
**Testing**: Jest/Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E
**Target Platform**: Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari latest versions)
**Project Type**: web - frontend visualization with backend API proxy
**Performance Goals**: 60 fps animation, <100ms response for hover interactions
**Constraints**: Handle up to 100 nodes with pods, real-time updates via WebSocket
**Scale/Scope**: ~100 nodes max, thousands of pods, all namespaces visible

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Since the constitution document is not yet filled in (template only), proceeding with standard best practices:
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns (frontend/backend)
- ✅ Testable architecture with contract tests
- ✅ Simple, focused functionality
- ✅ No unnecessary complexity

# Option 3: Mobile + API (when "iOS/Android" detected)
api/
└── [same as backend above]

ios/ or android/
└── [platform-specific structure]
```

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 - Web application (frontend + backend structure)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- WebSocket contract tests (connection, events, errors) [P]
- REST API contract tests (health, cluster info, resources) [P]
- Data model implementation (Node, Pod, Namespace, ClusterState) [P]
- Three.js scene setup and rendering pipeline
- Kubernetes client integration with watch streams
- WebSocket server implementation with event broadcasting
- Frontend 3D visualization components
- Animation system for pod create/delete
- Hover interaction and information display
- Quickstart validation tests

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests before implementation
- Infrastructure first: Backend setup → Frontend setup
- Data layer: Models → Services → API → UI
- Integration last: After all components working
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 30-35 numbered, ordered tasks covering:
- 8-10 test tasks (contract, unit, integration)
- 10-12 backend implementation tasks
- 8-10 frontend implementation tasks
- 3-4 integration and validation tasks

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (none required)
