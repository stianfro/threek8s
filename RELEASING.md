# Release Process

This document describes the release process for ThreeK8s, including automated releases via Release Please and manual release procedures.

## üöÄ Automated Releases (Recommended)

ThreeK8s uses [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) for automated semantic versioning and release management.

### How It Works

1. **Commit Convention**: Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:
   ```
   feat: add new visualization mode
   fix: resolve WebSocket reconnection issue
   docs: update installation guide
   chore: update dependencies
   ```

2. **Automatic PR Creation**: Release Please monitors the `main` branch and creates/updates a PR with:
   - Version bumps based on commit types
   - Updated CHANGELOG.md
   - Updated package.json versions

3. **Release Trigger**: When the Release Please PR is merged:
   - Creates a GitHub release with tag
   - Triggers Docker image builds and publishing
   - Publishes Helm chart to OCI registry
   - Updates release notes with artifact information

### Commit Types and Version Bumps

| Commit Type | Version Bump | Example |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| `feat:` | Minor (0.X.0) | New features |
| `fix:` | Patch (0.0.X) | Bug fixes |
| `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` | Major (X.0.0) | Breaking changes |
| `docs:`, `chore:`, `style:` | No bump | Documentation, maintenance |
| `perf:` | Patch | Performance improvements |

```

## üì¶ Release Artifacts

Each release produces the following artifacts:

### Docker Images
- `ghcr.io/stianfro/threek8s/backend:<version>`
- `ghcr.io/stianfro/threek8s/frontend:<version>`
- Multi-architecture support (amd64, arm64)
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Provenance and SBOM attestation

### Helm Chart
- `oci://ghcr.io/stianfro/threek8s/chart:<version>`
- Independent chart versioning
- OCI registry distribution
- Values schema validation

### GitHub Release
- Source code archives (zip, tar.gz)
- Release notes with changelog
- Deployment instructions
- Direct download links

## üîß Manual Release Process

If you need to create a release manually:

### 1. Update Versions

```bash
# Update version in root package.json
npm version <major|minor|patch>

# Update backend version
cd backend && npm version <major|minor|patch>

# Update frontend version
cd frontend && npm version <major|minor|patch>

# Update Helm chart version
# Edit helm/threek8s/Chart.yaml
# - version: X.Y.Z (chart version)
# - appVersion: X.Y.Z (application version)
```

### 2. Create Release Tag

```bash
# Create annotated tag
git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release v1.2.3"

# Push tag to trigger workflows
git push origin v1.2.3
```

### 3. Verify Release Workflows

Monitor GitHub Actions for:
- `Build Docker Images` workflow
- `Publish Docker Images` workflow
- `Publish Helm Chart` workflow

### 4. Test Released Artifacts

```bash
# Test Docker images
./tests/release/test-docker-images.sh

# Test Helm deployment
./tests/release/test-helm-deployment.sh

# Validate multi-arch manifests
./tests/release/validate-multi-arch.sh
```

## üè∑Ô∏è Version Management

### Application Versioning
- Follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
- Single version for entire application
- Synchronized across backend/frontend

### Helm Chart Versioning
- Independent from application version
- Chart version for Helm package changes
- App version references application release

Example:
```yaml
# Chart.yaml
version: 2.1.0      # Helm chart version
appVersion: "1.5.2" # Application version
```

## üîÑ Rollback Procedure

If a release has issues:

### Rollback Application

```bash
# Using Helm
helm rollback threek8s [REVISION]

# Using Docker
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --pull  # with previous version tags
```

### Rollback Release

```bash
# Delete the problematic release
gh release delete v1.2.3

# Delete the tag
git push --delete origin v1.2.3
git tag -d v1.2.3

# Fix issues and re-release
```

## üß™ Pre-Release Testing

Before merging the Release Please PR:

### 1. Build Test

```bash
# Test Docker builds
npm run docker:build

# Test Helm chart
helm lint helm/threek8s/
helm install --dry-run threek8s helm/threek8s/
```

### 2. Integration Test

```bash
# Start with docker-compose
docker-compose up -d

# Run smoke tests
curl http://localhost:8080/api/health
curl http://localhost:3000

# Check logs
docker-compose logs
```

### 3. Kubernetes Test

```bash
# Deploy to test cluster
helm install test-release helm/threek8s/ \
  --namespace test \
  --create-namespace

# Verify deployment
kubectl get pods -n test
helm test test-release -n test

# Cleanup
helm uninstall test-release -n test
```

## üìã Release Checklist

Before merging Release Please PR:

- [ ] All CI checks passing
- [ ] Docker builds successful
- [ ] Helm chart validates
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Breaking changes documented
- [ ] Migration guide provided (if needed)

After release:

- [ ] Images published to ghcr.io
- [ ] Helm chart available in OCI registry
- [ ] GitHub release created with notes
- [ ] Announcement made (if major release)

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Release Please Not Creating PR

1. Check commit format:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -10
   ```

2. Verify workflow runs:
   ```bash
   gh workflow view "Release Please"
   ```

3. Check branch protection rules

### Docker Build Failures

1. Test local build:
   ```bash
   docker build -t test backend/
   docker build -t test frontend/
   ```

2. Check multi-arch setup:
   ```bash
   docker buildx ls
   ```

### Helm Publishing Issues

1. Verify chart:
   ```bash
   helm package helm/threek8s/
   helm lint helm/threek8s/
   ```

2. Check registry access:
   ```bash
   helm registry login ghcr.io
   ```
